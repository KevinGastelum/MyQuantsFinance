# Quantitative Trading Strategies

The following is a brief summary of what you need to know about the Financial Market and different types of trading involved in FinTech

### Demistifying the Financial Market [(FinTech)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fintech#:~:text=Fintech%2C%20a%20clipped,fintech.%5B6%5D)

Learning about FinTech can be a daunting task, it's littered with complex terms designed to confuse you and scare you away. Those who do manage to navigate through the jargon, are now faced with the challenging task of competing against the Market Maker i.e., Financial Institutions, Large Banks and Firms.

Demistifying key terms:

- **Derivatives** - AKA Options, Futures, or Perpetuals - used to trade with margin.
- **Margin or Leverage** - Borrowing $ from exchanges to execute a trade, can lead to increased losses or increased profits.
  <br> $1,000 with 10x margin = $10,000 (Use with CAUTION this also means your losing money 10x faster) liquidation occurs once your liquidity runs out.
- **Assets** - Equities (Fancy name for Stocks), Commodities, Crypto
- **Liquidity** (Fancy way of saying Funds)

Knowing the basics is essential in everything, but especially when developing a winning strategy.

As I progress in my Quant journey I will begin by coding through some of these simple and commonly used indicators to automize my trading. From there we will use some

we will build a Backtesting script to test our results

### Basic trading strategies:

These are also commonly known as indicators, I will code these from scratch so I have

1. EMA (Exponential Moving Average) - Weighted moving average favoring recent prices. Used for trend identification.

2. RSI (Relative Strength Index) - Momentum oscillator measuring speed of price movements. Identifies overbought or oversold conditions.

3. VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price) - Average price based on volume and price, used as a trading benchmark.

5. Breakout Trading - Looks for levels or areas that a stock has been unable to move beyond, and waits for it to move beyond those levels
